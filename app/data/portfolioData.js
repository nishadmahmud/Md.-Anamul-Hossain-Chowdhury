  bio: [
    "I am Md. Anamul Hossain Chowdhury, a recently graduated Civil Engineer from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) with a CGPA of 3.77 out of 4.00, graduating with distinction and ranking third in my department. I achieved a perfect CGPA of 4.00 in my 6th semester and maintained above CGPA 3.90 in my last four semesters.",
    "Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant at Sylhet Engineering College and as Assistant Director at the UniV Research and Development Unit, where I manage projects on environmental modeling, water quality assessment, and data-driven analysis. I also serve as a Research Assistant in my thesis co-supervisor's lab at Sylhet Agricultural University, focusing on groundwater quality and pollution modeling.",
    "My research interests include groundwater pollution, air pollution, flood management, and coastal hazards in the context of climate change. I collaborated with a professor from the University of Newcastle, Australia, and published my first journal paper in Sustainable Water Resources Management (Springer), with several others currently under review. I have presented at major international and national conferences, including APTE 2024 at the National University of Singapore, ICCCNT 2025 at IIT Indore, India, and ICWFM 2025 at BUET, Bangladesh.",
    "In addition, I served as an Exam Coordinator for the Bangladesh Environment Olympiad and as a Reviewer for the International Journal of Environment and Climate Change. I also achieved notable success in national truss competitions—Champion at IUT Cennovation 2024, 1st Runner-up at DUET Civilization Season-1, and 4th Place in Quake Quest. I have held leadership roles as Scholarship and Higher Study Secretary of SEC Civil Society, Organizing Secretary at the CE Center of Research, and Campus Ambassador for national programs such as the English Olympiad, ICT Olympiad, and International Leadership Competition.",
    "My technical expertise includes AutoCAD, ArcGIS Pro, SPSS, Python, and machine learning. I aim to advance research on data-driven, sustainable, and science-based environmental solutions.",
