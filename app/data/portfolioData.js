  bio: [
    "I am Md. Anamul Hossain Chowdhury, a recently graduated Civil Engineer from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) with a CGPA of 3.77 out of 4.00, graduating with distinction and ranking third in my department. I achieved a perfect CGPA of 4.00 in my 6th semester and maintained above CGPA 3.90 in my last four semesters.",
    "Currently, I am working as a Teaching Assistant at Sylhet Engineering College and as Assistant Director at the UniV Research and Development Unit, where I manage projects related to environmental modeling, water quality assessment, and data-driven analysis. I also serve as a Research Assistant at Sylhet Agricultural University, focusing on groundwater quality and pollution modeling.",
    "My research interests include groundwater pollution, soil degradation, flood management, and coastal hazards in the context of climate change. I have worked in collaboration with a professor from the University of Newcastle, Australia, and my first journal paper was published in the Sustainable Water Resources Management journal (Springer), with several more currently under peer review.",
    "Beyond academics, I have achieved success in national competitions and held leadership positions in various organizations. My technical skills include proficiency in AutoCAD, ArcGIS Pro, SPSS, Python, and machine learning applications. I aim to pursue advanced research focused on developing data-driven, sustainable, and science-based solutions for global environmental protection and resilience.",
